## Demo project for Betfair

This demo uses the base code from the [prismic-demo](https://github.com/arnaudlewis/prismic-demo).

Here are the [prismic repository](https://betfair-demo.prismic.io/) and the [live demo site](https://afternoon-sands-23736.herokuapp.com/).


This project contains a single lobby page which links to multiple games.

The lobby page uses slices to display the different featured games.
